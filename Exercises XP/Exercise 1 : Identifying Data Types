Exercise 1: Identifying Data Types

A companyâ€™s financial reports stored in an Excel file represent structured data because they are organized in tables, making them easy to analyze.

Photographs uploaded to a social media platform are examples of unstructured data because they lack a defined format or structure, making analysis difficult.

A collection of news articles on a website also falls under unstructured data as the text of the articles doesn't have a predetermined structure, making it challenging to process automatically.

Inventory data in a relational database is structured data since it's organized in tables with defined rows and columns, facilitating search and analysis.

Recorded interviews from a market research study are considered unstructured data because audio and video files don't have a predefined structure, making analysis complex.

In summary, structured data is easily organized and analyzed, such as tables in a database, while unstructured data lacks a clear structure, making it challenging to analyze, like text and images.
